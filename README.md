## 📹 Demo
First, see it in action:
1. Ensure Firebase / Cloudinary backends are properly configured.
```
> Check the .env file for CLOUDINARY backend
> Ensure you have a proper online Firebase backend
```
2. Run the Flutter app.

```
cd soulful
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
3. In the app
- Sign up or log in with email/password
- Tap the file picker, choose an image or video
- Upload to Cloudinary from the Upload screen
- Preview uploads via the image/video preview screens


## 🔍 Project Overview

### Problem
- Provide a simple, reliable mobile UI for authenticated users to pick, upload, and preview media files while handling async operations safely and showing clear feedback.

### Key Components
- Firebase Authentication (email/password)
- File selection using FilePicker
- Cloudinary upload service (service_cloudinary)
- Image and video preview screens (network loading, error handling, pinch/zoom, playback controls)
- Robust lifecycle handling (mounted checks, controller disposal)
- Minimal route table for quick integration


## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ex-rnd/Soulful-Drive-Upload-Using-Flutter-Cloudinary.git
cd soulful
```

2. Frontend setup
- Install dependencies.
```bash
flutter pub get
```
- Create a `.env` in the project root and add keys (example).
```bash
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
```

- Configure Firebase.
- Replace `lib/firebase_options.dart` with the file generated by the Firebase CLI (or update the existing file to match your Firebase project).
-	Ensure `main.dart` loads dotenv before calling `Firebase.initializeApp()` if you depend on env values.

3. Run the app
- Navigate to the flutter folder.
```bash
flutter run
```


## ▶️ Usage
### Quick Flow.
- Sign up → Log in → Pick file → Upload → Preview


### Example: pick & navigate to upload.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f190dd84-f459-4932-9853-fd107368817f

```
final result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles();
if (result != null) {
  Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/upload', arguments: result);
}
```

### Example: upload handler

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f190dd84-f459-4932-9853-fd107368817f

```
final success = await uploadToCloudinary(selectedFile);
if (success) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(const SnackBar(content: Text('Uploaded')));
  Navigator.pop(context);
}
```

### Preview image/video
```
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => PreviewImage(url: uploadedUrl)));
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => PreviewVideo(videoUrl: uploadedVideoUrl)));
```


### Flutter Front-End.
- Ensure your emulator or device is connected
- From project root:
```
cd frontend
flutter run
```

## 🚀 App Flow & Routes
— `/` Splash check (CheckUserLoggedIn) redirects to `/home` or `/login` 
— `/home` Home / main content (uploads list placeholder)
— `/login` LoginPage (email/password)
— `/signup` SignUpPage (name, contact, email, password)
— `/upload` UploadArea (expects a `FilePickerResult` via route args)
- Preview screens: `PreviewImage`, `Preview Video` 

## 📁 File overview (important files)

#### 	lib/main.dart
- 	App entry: dotenv + Firebase init, route table, CheckUserLoggedIn splash
####	lib/views/signup.dart
- 	Sign-up form: name, contact, email, password; validators, loading state, controller disposal
####	lib/views/login.dart
- 	Login form: email, password; validators, loading state, safe navigation
#### 	lib/views/upload_screen.dart
- 	UploadArea: shows file info; uploads via `uploadToCloudinary()` with loading state and error handling
#### 	lib/views/preview_image.dart
- 	Image preview: loadingBuilder, errorBuilder, InteractiveViewer (pinch/zoom)
####	lib/views/preview_video.dart
- 	Video preview: `video_player` controller init/dispose, playback controls, progress, error states
#### 	lib/services/service_firebase.dart
- 	AuthService: `createAccountWithEmail`, `loginWithEmail`, `isLoggedIn` (wrap Firebase auth)
####	lib/services/service_cloudinary.dart
- 	`uploadToCloudinary(FilePickerResult)` — recommended to return typed `UploadResult`

## 🔐 Environment & secret
- 	Never commit secrets. Use `.env` locally and environment injection for CI/CD.
- 	Required env keys (example): `FIREBASE_*`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`.

## 🔜 Next steps / improvements (roadmaP)
- ✅ Add typed AuthResult / UploadResult and refactor service returns
- ➕ Upload progress UI and resumable uploads (high priority)
- 🗂️ Persist uploads metadata and show thumbnails list on HomePage (high priority)
- 🧪 Add unit & widget tests and CI checks (medium priority)
- 🔐 Move upload signing server-side or use signed uploads for improved security (medium priority)
- 🌐 Support multiple file selection and batch uploads (future
